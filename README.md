# yzhang_stdpopsim_pig_recomb

Formatting genetic map (recombination rate map) for pig species in
[stdpopsim](https://github.com/popsim-consortium/stdpopsim).

We used the IPython notebook in `format_for_stdpopsim.ipynb` to
format the recombination rate map into the `RateMap` format used
by `stdpopsim`.
See details in the notebook.

The maps were then shared with `stdpopsim` maintainers.
